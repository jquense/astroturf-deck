import Split from "./Split";

<Split transition="ðŸ‘‰">

```css
/* text.module.css */

.heavy {
  font-weight: 700;
}

.title {
  color: white;
}

.heading {
  composes: title heavy;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

```css
._heavy-t0gZ1 {
  font-weight: 700;
}
._title-t0gZ1 {
  color: white;
}
._heading-20g65 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

```json
{
  "heavy": "_heavy-t0gZ",
  "title": "_title-t0gZ1",
  "heading": "_heading-20g65 _heavy-t0gZ1 _title-t0gZ1"
}
```

</Split>

<Notes>
  Effectively you get two files:

- the plain css file with mangled classNames

- json file that contains the mapping of the mangled class names to the original
  ones: e.g. 'heavy' -> '\_23_aKvs-b8bW2Vg3fwHozO'

</Notes>

---

```jsx
import { heading } from "./text.module.css";

return function Heading() {
  return (
    <h2 className={heading}>A Bold Title</h2>
  );
};
```

_becomes_

```html
<h2
  class="_heading-20g65 _heavy-t0gZ1 _title-t0gZ1"
>
  A Bold Title
</h2>
```

<Notes>
  When you import the css file, what you get is
  actually the JSON file containing the mappings

## PRO TIP

CSS Modules invented a little DSL for describing which things are "exports" and which are
are "imports".

Generally this is used for importing and exporting classNames butâ€¦

**you can use it _for any value_**

---

`breakpoints.module.css`

```css
:export {
  medium: 998px;
  small: 746px;
}
```

`display-utils.module.css`

```css
:import("./breakpoint.module.css") {
  breakpoint: small;
}

@media (max-width: breakpoint) {
  .display-mobile {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  You almost never see this format b/c it ends up
  being an intermediary compile step. For instance
  css-loader looks for imports and exports in
  order to create the JSON mapping, and then
  removes the fake psuedo selectors from the css.

## Ok now astroturf

Built on top of css-modules, the core technolody is you write a css file in
a tagged template string and astroturf turns that into a REAL css file and _replaces_
the template with an import to that file.

---

<Split transition="ðŸ‘‰">

```jsx
import { css } from 'astroturf'

const color = 'white';

const styles = css`
  .title {
    color: $\{color};
  }
`

<h2 classNames={styles.title} />
```

```jsx
const styles = require("./Title-styles.module.css");

const color = "white";

const title = <h2 classNames={styles.title} />;
```

<small>&</small>

```css
.title {
  color: white;
}
```

</Split>

Uses babel plugin to manpulate the code via an AST

```json
{
  "type": "TaggedTemplateExpression",
  "tag": {
    "type": "Identifier",
    "name": "css"
  },
  "quasi": {
    "type": "TemplateLiteral",
    "expressions": [],
    "quasis": [
      {
        "type": "TemplateElement",
        "value": {
          "raw": "\n  .title {\n    color: white;\n  }\n"
        },
        "tail": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Analysis if there are any interpolations and whether they are statically
  evaluatable

- We generate the string of css and save to a css file

- replace the tagged template node with an `require()`
  to the file we generated

---

The extracted CSS file makes it's way through webpack.

Because it's simply a css file
any style pipeline that has been defined will be applied to that file.

This means you get static extraction for free, as well as use with any CSS preprocessor
such as Sass in our case

<Notes>
The secret is we optimize how the file is generated. b/c webpack eventually
turns all files into concatnated bundles, there isn't any need to write the file
to disk, only to be turned into a large css file later.

So instead of that we instrument the webpack File System object and save the css files
as "Virtual" files, only visible to webpack but act like a real file

Styled Component API

---

<Split transition="ðŸ‘‰">

```js
const Button = styled("button")`
  color: blue;
  padding: 0 20px;

  &.size-large {
    font-size: 120%;
  }
`;
```

```jsx
const styles = require("./Button-button.module.css");

function Button({ size, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      {...props}
      classNames={classNames(
        styles.button,
        styles["size-" + size]
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

<small>&</small>

```css
.button {
  color: blue;
  padding: 0 20px;
}

.button.size-large {
  font-size: 120%;
}
```

</Split>

<Notes>
In principle the component API is the same as the css tag one, the style is
extracted and replaced with a `require`.

The difference is it's wrapped in a helper that returns a react component,
and applies a bit of a heuristic for mapping props to class names

</Notes>

MOAR PRO TIPS

- vscode/atom have styled-components extensions for syntax highlighting, they also work with astroturf

- Static interpolations aren't the smartest, but also not dumb, e.g. you can do math

- `css` along with the `:export {}` syntax lets you share values with JS
